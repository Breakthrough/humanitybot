humanitybot
===========

humanitybot is a Cards Against Humanity IRC bot.  Most of the basic functionality is complete, and implementing SSL support and easier configuration is a current development priority.  humanitybot includes the official Cards Against Humanity deck, and one can easily add/remove entries directly in the `cards.py` file.

This repository is an actively developed fork based on the [original humanitybot](https://github.com/SuperMatt/humanitybot).  Feel free to submit bug reports or feature request to the [humanitybot issue tracker](https://github.com/Breakthrough/humanitybot/issues).
